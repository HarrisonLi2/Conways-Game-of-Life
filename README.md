# Conways-Game-of-Life : A zero player, state-based, evolution game with four simple rules

Devised by British mathematician John Conway

Written in Java using the Swing & AWT GUI Frameworks

===========================================================================================

Assumptions
===========
On a 2D Grid, a viable Cell has 8 neighbors.

A dead cell is dark (0). No one is home...

A living cell is colored (1). 

Four Rules
===========
1. Underpopulation: A living cell with less than 3 living neighbors becomes a dead cell.

2. Overpopulation: A living cell with 4 or more neighbors becomes a dead cell.

3. Persistence: A living cell with 2 or 3 living neighbors lives another generation.

4. Reproduction: A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes a live cell.
